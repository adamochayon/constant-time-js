## Documentation

* `compare(a, b)` - Compare two `Uint8Array` objects.
  * Returns `-1` if `a < b`
  * Returns `1` if `a > b`
  * Returns `0` if `a === b`
  * Throws an `Error` if `a.length !== b.length`
* `compare_ints(a, b)` - Compare two integers.
  * Returns `-1` if `a < b`
  * Returns `1` if `a > b`
  * Returns `0` if `a === b`
* `equals(a, b)` - Are these `Uint8Array` objects equal?
  * Returns `true` if they are equal.
  * Returns `false` if they are not equal.
  * Throws an `Error` if `a.length !== b.length`
* `hmac_equals(a, b)` - Are these `Uint8Array` objects equal? (Using HMAC to compare.)
  * Returns `true` if they are equal.
  * Returns `false` if they are not equal.
  * Throws an `Error` if `a.length !== b.length`
* `intdiv(N, D)` - Divide `N` into `D`, discarding remainder.
  * Returns an integer.
* `modulo(N, D)` - Divide `N` into `D`, return the remainder.
  * Returns an integer.
* `resize(buf, size)` - Return a resized `Uint8Array` object (to side-step memory access leakage)
* `select(x, a, b)` - Read it as a ternary. If `x` is true, returns `a`. Otherwise, returns `b`.
  * `x` must be a `boolean`
  * `a` must be a `Uint8Array`
  * `b` must be a `Uint8Array`
  * Throws an `Error` if `a.length !== b.length`
* `select_ints(x, a, b)` - Read it as a ternary. If `x` is even, returns `a`. Otherwise, returns `b`. 
  (You should pass `1` or `0` for `x`).
  * `x` must be a `boolean`
  * `a` must be a `number`
  * `b` must be a `number`
* `trim_zeroes_left(buf)`
  * `buf` must be a `Uint8Array`
  * Returns a `Uint8Array`
* `trim_zeroes_right(buf)`
  * `buf` must be a `Uint8Array`
  * Returns a `Uint8Array`

## Limitations

### Do not use on 32-bit processes.

32-bit v8 (and, presumably, a lot of other implementations) do things wrong, and this will be variable-time on it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### But Why Though?

![Mwahahahahahaha!](https://soatok.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/soatok_stickerpack-evil-laughter.png)

**For science!**

This is a proof-of-concept library, that will eventually implement
all of the algorithms described in [the accompanying blog post](https://soatok.blog/2020/08/27/soatoks-guide-to-side-channel-attacks/).

### What's with the blue {fox, wolf}?

My fursona is a [dhole](https://soatok.blog/2020/08/10/all-about-dholes-and-dhole-fursonas/), not a wolf.

### You should remove your fursona from this so my manager might take it seriously.

I don't owe you anything. I don't owe your manager anything.

Besides, if anyone is bigoted against a [predominantly LGBTQIA+ community](https://furscience.com/research-findings/sex-relationships-pornography/5-1-orientation/),
they're precisely the sort of person whose career I don't want to help.
